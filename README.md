# homework-task2

This weeks homework task was to create a portfolio/bio website drawig o the kowledge and practice thhat we have been throughh over the last 2 weeks.

Functions required as a minimum by the site:
        - a navbar 
        - responsive page layout
        - responsive images
    ~without excessive use of media queries
           BONUS
            +sticky footer 
            +use sub col and sub rows on portfolio page

I first approached this by wire-framing out each of the page designs in my notebook to give me an opportuity to think about style, design flow - and probably most importantly which layout structures would be needed. Particularly useful for understading my grid strucutre whhere it would be used.

The great thing about a resource such as bootstrap is that thhey hhave many avaliable classes desinged with responsive page elements very much as thhe number 1 priority. In todays day and age you really ca't design websites withhout consdierig hhow they will act and perform whhen viewed on a mobile device - as most content that is avaliable in the ecosphere is consumed.

Committing - i found myself getting stuck withh certain page elements which meant that i spennt a long period of time trying different solutions without committing my exact chhanges, as most did not result in a solution.
